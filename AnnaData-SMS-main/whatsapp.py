"""
WhatsApp Cloud API channel.

A second way in, added because the SMS path depends on one handset with one SIM
and that handset stopped working. WhatsApp reaches a different farmer - one with
a smartphone - so it widens the audience rather than replacing it, and Meta
hosts the connection, so nothing here depends on a device staying awake.

Two things make it worth having beyond redundancy. Free-form replies are
permitted inside the twenty-four hour window a farmer's own message opens, which
is the regulatory problem the SMS channel cannot solve at scale. And a test
number is issued before any business verification, so the channel can be run
today without a SIM.

The farmer is the same person on both channels, so identifiers are normalised to
the same form the SMS side stores. Someone who asks over SMS and later asks on
WhatsApp keeps their district, their crops and their history.
