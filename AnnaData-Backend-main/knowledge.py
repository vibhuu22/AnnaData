"""
Grounded knowledge: approved pesticide doses, and retrieved reference text.

Two stores, because the two problems are not alike.

`pesticide_uses` is a structured table looked up on crop and pest. A dose is a
precise fact with a right answer, and semantic similarity is the wrong tool for
it - retrieving prose that mentions a chemical does not tell you the approved
rate for this crop and this pest. Matching on the pair does, and it also lets
the agent do the thing that matters most: say nothing when the pair is not
registered, rather than produce a plausible number.

`documents` is a pgvector store for the open-ended material - schemes,
subsidies, storage, general practice - where there is no single right answer and
similarity is exactly right.

Both live in the Postgres already provisioned for farmer profiles, so this adds
no infrastructure and no cost.
