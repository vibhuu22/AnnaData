"""
Farmer profiles and conversation history.

Two kinds of memory live here, and they deliberately have different lifetimes:

  profile facts  - location, crops, language. Persist indefinitely; a farmer in
                   Vidarbha growing cotton is still there next month.
  session context - the last few messages, so follow-ups make sense. Expires
                   after CONTEXT_TTL_HOURS so a conversation from three weeks
                   ago cannot bleed into today's question.

Every function degrades to a no-op when the database is unavailable, so the
agent keeps working exactly as it did before profiles existed.
