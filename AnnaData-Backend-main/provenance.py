"""
What AnnaData can do, and where its answers come from.

Two different questions get asked, and they need different answers.

"What can you help me with?" wants capabilities, in the farmer's terms - pest
control, fertiliser, when to sow - not the names of the APIs behind them. No
farmer cares that the soil figure came from OpenLandMap until they ask where it
came from.

"How do you know about my soil?" wants provenance, and deserves the truth
rather than a recalled account of how soil is tested in general.

Both are assembled from live state: which integrations are configured, how many
registered pesticide uses are loaded, which scheme documents are in the store.
An earlier version of this file listed three data sources and was never updated
as the dose table and the document store were added, so a farmer asking what
the service could do was told a smaller and older truth than the real one - and
asked about government schemes, was told there were none while the store held
eighty-six passages about them. A self-description that is not derived from the
system is a self-description that goes stale silently.
