"""
Asking farmers what they thought, and storing it usefully.

A rating on its own tells you a farmer was unhappy. A rating stored beside what
the conversation was about - the intent, which tools ran, the language, the
crop, whether a dose was given or refused - tells you *what kind* of question
goes wrong, which is the thing that can be acted on. So the features a model
would eventually need are recorded at the same time as the number, because they
cannot be reconstructed afterwards.

Timing follows two rules that have to be reconciled. A rating should be asked
while the conversation is fresh, which means shortly after it ends; and it
should be asked at most once a month, on a day drawn per farmer rather than a
shared one. Those conflict if the drawn day is treated as the day to send - a
farmer whose last conversation was two weeks earlier is being asked about
something they no longer remember. So the drawn day is the *earliest eligible*
day, and the ask goes out after the first conversation that ends on or after
it.
